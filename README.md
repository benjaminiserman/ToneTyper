a small program for typing pinyin tones

Compatible with Windows 10 (and probably other Windows versions too, but untested. If it works on a version not listed here, please tell me!)
If ToneTyper does not work on your Windows computer, try out the "self-contained.zip" release instead.

ToneTyper allows you to type the tone marks for pinyin syllables For example, "Zho1ngguo2" => "Zhōngguó".

By default, the character 'ü' can be accessed by typing "uu". This behavior can be changed instead so that 'v' is converted into 'ü'

To use, run ToneTyper.exe. Then:

To escape a character, type an apostrophe before the u or number. For example, typing "a'3" will result in "a3".

To pause or resume ToneTyper, click its icon on the system tray, or use the hotkey "Alt + P".

To change the toggle hotkey, right-click the ToneTyper icon on the system tray and choose "Change Hotkey".

To change the Ü mode, right-click the ToneTyper icon on the system tray and choose "Toggle Ü Mode".

To exit ToneTyper, right-click its icon on the system tray and choose "Exit".
