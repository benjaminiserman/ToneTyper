# Iksokodo
a background service that converts keystrokes into the Esperanto X-system.

Compatible with Windows 10 (and probably other Windows versions too, but untested. If it works on a version not listed here, please tell me!)
If Iksokodo does not work on your Windows computer, try out the "self-contained.zip" release instead.

This is a continuation of https://github.com/winggar/XSistemoKonvertilo

To use, run Iksokodo.exe. Then:

When typing in the Esperanto X-System, keystrokes will be converted to their Esperanto equivalent. For example, typing "cx" will result in "ĉ".

To escape a character, type an apostrophe before the x. For example, typing "c'x" will result in "cx".

To pause or resume Iksokodo, click its icon on the system tray, or use the hotkey "Alt + E".

To change the toggle hotkey, right-click the Iksokodo icon on the system tray and choose "Change Hotkey".

To exit Iksokodo, right-click its icon on the system tray and choose "Exit".
